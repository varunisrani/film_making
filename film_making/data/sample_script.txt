TITLE: THE LAST MEETING

FADE IN:

EXT. IIM AHMEDABAD CAMPUS - MORNING

The sun rises over the prestigious IIM Ahmedabad campus. Students hurry across the grounds, some carrying laptops, others deep in conversation.

RAHUL (28), ambitious and sharp-dressed, walks confidently through the campus, checking his watch.

RAHUL
(to himself)
Last day. Make it count.

INT. IIM AHMEDABAD - CLASSROOM - MORNING

A spacious classroom with tiered seating. PROFESSOR SHARMA (55), distinguished and stern, writes on the whiteboard as students file in.

Rahul enters, spots his friend PRIYA (27), intelligent with a quiet confidence, and sits beside her.

PRIYA
Ready for the presentation?

RAHUL
Born ready. Did you finish the market analysis?

PRIYA
(showing her laptop)
Just completed it at 3 AM. The Chennai market data was harder to find than I expected.

PROFESSOR SHARMA
Good morning, everyone. Today is your final presentation day. Remember, this counts for 40% of your grade.

The students exchange nervous glances.

INT. IIM AHMEDABAD - CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

A sleek conference room with a large presentation screen. Rahul stands at the front, presenting confidently to a panel of PROFESSORS and visiting BUSINESS EXECUTIVES.

RAHUL
Our analysis shows a 23% growth potential in the Chennai market, provided the right distribution channels are established.

Priya operates the slides, nodding supportively.

EXECUTIVE 1
And what about the competition from international brands?

RAHUL
(confidently)
We've accounted for that. If you'll turn to page 15 of our report...

EXT. IIM AHMEDABAD CAMPUS - GARDEN - EVENING

The sun sets over the campus. Rahul and Priya sit on a bench, looking relieved.

PRIYA
We did it. Two years of hard work, finally done.

RAHUL
(thoughtful)
Remember when we first met? You thought my business model was, and I quote, "fundamentally flawed."

They both laugh.

PRIYA
Well, it was. But you've come a long way.

A moment of silence between them.

RAHUL
So, Chennai?

PRIYA
(nodding)
The job offer is too good to pass up.

RAHUL
(hesitant)
I got an offer too. Same company.

Priya looks at him, surprised.

PRIYA
You never mentioned applying there.

RAHUL
I wanted it to be a surprise. If you wanted me there.

Their hands touch on the bench.

INT. CHENNAI OFFICE - BOARDROOM - MORNING - ONE YEAR LATER

A modern boardroom with views of Chennai's skyline. Rahul and Priya, now in sharp business attire, present to a room of EXECUTIVES.

RAHUL
The expansion has exceeded our projections by 15%.

PRIYA
And we're ready to move into phase two of the market development.

They exchange a confident glance, partners in every sense.

FADE OUT.
